The [results](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/results.html)
of the First International Competition on Computational Models of
Argument (ICCMA) are now available.

And the winners are:

1. [CoQuiAAS](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/pdf/paper_8.pdf)
2. [ArgSemSAT](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/pdf/paper_10.pdf)
3. [LabSATSolver](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/pdf/paper_4.pdf)

Congratulations!

Our own entry, [Carneades
4.0](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/pdf/paper_5.pdf), placed 2nd in all four
of the grounded semantics "tracks", and 7th overall, in a field of [18
solvers](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/solvers.html).

As
[expected](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/pdf/paper_5.pdf),
in the tracks for the intractable tasks (no pun indented), we didn't
stand a chance against the systems using SAT solvers. The
argumentation frameworks used were too large for our straightforward
generate and test algorithm.

You can try out the Carneades solver for Dung abstract argumentation
frameworks online if you would like, using the [Carneades
server](http://carneades.fokus.fraunhofer.de).
