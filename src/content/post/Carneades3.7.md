Carneades 3.7 is now available for downloading. This version of
Carneades is a web application, with a three-tiered architecture. The
web client of this version has been completing rewritten to make use
of modern JavaScript libraries for interactive web applications. The
user interface is designed to be usable on all devices, including
smart phones and tablets, as well as desktop computers.

See the
[Carneades 3.7 User Manual](https://carneades.github.io/manuals/Carneades3.7/carneades-3.7-manual.pdf)
for futher information about downloading, installing and using the
system.

Caveat: Carneades is a research prototype, not production-quality
software. The 3.7 version of Carneades is work in progress, has not
been thoroughly tested and is missing some planned features.
