Version 4.2 of Carneades was released today.  New in 4.2 are:

- User-definable argument evaluation functions, for deriving relative
  argument weights from properties of the arguments (4.1 included a few
  builtin argument evaluation functions.)
- A language, based on YAML, for representing argumentation schemes. 
- Automatic argument construction from argumentation schemes and assumptions 
  via an inference engine implemented using
  [Constraint Handling Rules](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CHR/). 

As before, you can try Carneades 4.2 online using the
[Carneades server](http://carneades.fokus.fraunhofer.de) without
having to build or install the system yourself.

The source code is available in the [Carneades-4
Github](https://github.com/carneades/carneades-4) project. The code is
open source, using the [MPL-2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)
