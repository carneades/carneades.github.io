The Carneades argumentation system provides software tools for: 

- (re)constructing arguments using a rulebase of argumentation schemes
- visualizing arguments in diagrams (argument maps)
- critically evaluating arguments, using argumentation schemes and a
  formal model of structured argument.
- serializing and interchanging arguments using our own
  Carneades Argument Format (CAF) as well as the Argument Interchange Format
  (AIF)

For licensing information, see the particular release (below) of
